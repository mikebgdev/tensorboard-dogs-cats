## Description

In this project, I utilized TensorBoard along with TensorFlow in Python to develop a model for detecting dogs and cats through a camera feed. After collecting and cleaning a dataset of labeled images, I trained the model using deep learning techniques. I used TensorBoard to visualize and monitor the model's performance during training, enabling me to fine-tune parameters and enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, I implemented a real-time camera interface to showcase the model's capability to identify objects on the fly. This project not only provided me with a deeper understanding of TensorFlow and TensorBoard tools but also allowed me to delve into the exciting field of computer vision and applied artificial intelligence.
